## Modifications

#### M4 holes

All parts that mount to 20x20 extrusions are modified to use M4 screws instead of the default M5. Therefore it's possible to use Type I extrusions which have a 5mm slot and can take M4 nuts max.

#### Round holes

The rectangular slots that allow putting nuts through a part are replaced with round (elongated) holes. There's no need to have large slots if you use t-slot sliding nuts that can be inserted to the slot anywhere.

#### Slot guide for Z endstop adjust

The Z endstop adjust now has a small slot guide to prevent twisting.
