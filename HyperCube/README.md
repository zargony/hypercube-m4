# HyperCube 3D Printer M4 Variant

This is a derivation of Tech2C's excellent [HyperCube 3D printer](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1752766). Most noticable differences to original parts are M4 holes for mounting plastic parts to I-type extrusions.

See links below for other things related to my customized HyperCube 3D printer build.

Only modified parts are contained here. For the full list of parts, refer to the original build instructions.

## Modifications

#### M4 holes

All parts that mount to 20x20 extrusions are modified to use M4 screws instead of the default M5. Therefore it's possible to use Type I extrusions which have a 5mm slot and can take M4 nuts max.

#### Round holes

The rectangular slots that allow putting nuts through a part are replaced with round (elongated) holes. There's no need to have large slots if you use t-slot sliding nuts that can be inserted to the slot anywhere.

#### Slot guide for Z endstop adjust

The Z endstop adjust now has a small slot guide to prevent twisting.
